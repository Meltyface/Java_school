Real world objects contain state and behaviour.
A software object's state is stored in fields
A software object's behaviour is exposed through methods.
Hiding internal data from the outside world, accessing only through publicly exposed methods is known as data encapsulation.
A blueprint for a software is called a class.
Common behaviour can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a subclass using the 'extends' keyword.
A collection of methods with no implementation is called an 'interface'.
A namespace that organises classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.
The term API stands for Application Programming Interface.
