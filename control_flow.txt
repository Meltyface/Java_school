The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming langauge is the if-then statement.
The else statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
The for statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the start of the loop.
Infinite for loop: for ( ; ; ) {}
Infinite while loop: while (true) {}
