Class: A blueprint, defining what an object should do, without executing the commands themselves. Classes define what properties (fields) and actions (methods) an object can have.

Object: An instance of a class that can act on the commands within the class.

Public: The most accessible type; allows other functions, variables, etc. to access values or commands herein. 

Private: Only available for functions, variables, etc. that have permission to access.

Protected: No other object may access this.

[Blank]: Unclear

Static: Definition belongs to class, not object instance. Main method is always static.

Void: Object has no return value.

Commit: "Super save"; allows user to access all previous versions of the saved repository. 

Abstract class: "Cookie cutter shape" for other classes. 

Extends: "is a"

TDD: Test-Driven Development

Top-Down: Building a program by examining the desired outputs, and building backward; start with a method to achieve the output, and build a system around it.

Bottom-Up: Building a program by considering how it could achieve the desired outputs, but starting with the broadest scope of the system, and building toward the final result.

Ternary Operator: Boolean operation in the format <x> ? <y> : <z> where <x> is an if statement, which defaults to <y> if true, and <z> if false.
